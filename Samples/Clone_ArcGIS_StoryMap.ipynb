    "# Clone an ArcGIS StoryMap\n",
    "\n",
    "A Notebook to guide you through you through the steps of cloning an ArcGIS StoryMap. (It is not for cloning Classic StoryMap apps.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this Notebook is to support situations where a \"full\" clone of StoryMap is required. Where the person creating the StoryMap wants to keep a copy for themselves, under their full control, however, they also need to provide a copy of the StoryMap to someone else, who will then have full control over that copy.\n",
    "\n",
    "This Notebook defines \"full\" clone as cloning not only the StoryMap, but also any referenced content in the StoryMap that is owned by the same user as the StoryMap. Cloning referenced content is supported for the major content types (images, express maps, web maps, web scenes, feature layers, etc.). For unsupported content types, the reference to the orignal item wil be carried through to the cloned StoryMap. Similarly, for referenced content that is not owned by the same user, the reference to the original item will be maintained in the clone."

    "## Some Additional Notes\n",
    "* The code in this Notebook is designed for readability and understanding of the various steps. It is not optimized.\n",
    "* It is generally recommended that the user running this Notebook have the built-in Administrator role. The user running the Notebook needs to have full access to the StoryMap (and any referenced content) to create a full copy. If the user only has view access to the StoryMap, then the Notebook can only clone the published version of the StoryMap. Any unpublished edits in the draft version will not be accessible, and, therefore, not included in the cloned StoryMap. (The latter situation can occur even when running as an Administrator, if you are not an Administrator on the system from which the StoryMap is beling cloned; for example, when you are cloning a StoryMap from a public ArcGIS Online account.)\n",
    "* If a StoryMap is shared with a Shared Update group, then the user running this Notebook need only be a member of that group with access to edit the StoryMap for the Notebook to be able to clone any draft version of the StoryMap, in addition to the published version.\n",
    "* Cloning a StoryMap produces a new item, which means a new URL. For certain use cases, you may want to change the ownershp of the original StoryMap (and appropriate referenced content) to the person for whom the clone is being made, so that references to the original URL are maintained, and then clone the StoryMap back to the original owner. For example, if a student makes StoryMap on behalf of faculty member, and the faculty member has already been distributing or linking to that StoryMap's URL, then it would be best to make the faculty member the owner of the original StoryMap, and produce a clone of it for the student.\n",
    "* The sharing settings for the original StoryMap are not carried over to the clone. The cloned StoryMap is initially only visible to its owner."
